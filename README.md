# Attendance
A simple [Sakai](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai) tool for tracking attendance that integrates with the Gradebook.

## Compatibility
Version 1.0 of Attendance is compatible with Sakai 11. Though, there are some UI changes which are still necessary. 

The Sakai property auto.ddl should be set to true when first starting this tool with Sakai.
If not, queries for MySQL and Oracle can be found in [docs/sql/](docs/sql/)
